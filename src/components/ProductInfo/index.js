            Hondaâ€™s RA621 was in essence an all-new design, 
            within what is allowed by the power unit regulations. 
            It was smaller and more powerful than the 2020 power unit. 
            A major re-assessment of priorities between combustion chamber efficiency and energy 
            captured by the exhaust led to a totally new cylinder head.
          </p>
          <p className="info">
          Increased valve angles (the angle between the inlet and exhaust valves) allowed the head to be lower and for the camshafts to be smaller in diameter. 
          A different material for the block allowed the gap between the cylinders to be smaller.
